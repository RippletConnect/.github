Ripplet is a connection platform born on the UCI campus, designed to help students meet people who share their interests. From anime to hiking, late-night boba runs to building side projects, Ripplet connects you with your community.

The best connections start small — a ripple — and grow into something real.

- Profile customization based on your genuine interests
- Discovery of others with shared passions
- Thoughtful matching to build real friendships and conversations
